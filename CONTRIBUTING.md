# Contributing to Kitsu

Thank you for reading this! This document has some notes on contributing to the development of Kitsu.

## Reporting bugs

You can submit bug reports either in the Github issue tracker or the [bug tracker](https://kitsu.io/feedback/bugs/).

Before submitting an issue please check if there is already an existing issue. If there is, please add any additional information and upvote the issue.

When submitting an issue please describe the issue clearly, including how to reproduce the bug, which situations it appears in, what you expect to happen, what actually happens, and what platform (browser and operating system) you are using.  We find screenshots (for front-end issues) very helpful.

## Pull Requests

We love pull requests! We are very happy to work with you to get your changes merged in, however please keep the following in mind.

* Adhere to the coding conventions you see in the surrounding code.
* Include tests, and make sure all tests pass.
* Before submitting a pull-request, clean up the history by going over your commits and squashing together minor changes and fixes into the corresponding commits. You can do this using the interactive rebase command.

## What to work on

If you want to help out with Kitsu but are not sure what to work on check out the [reported bugs](https://kitsu.io/feedback/bugs) and [feature requests](https://kitsu.io/feedback/feature-requests) for some ideas.

## Security

Please do not publish security vulnerabilities before giving us a chance to fix them. All security issues should be reported to [security@kitsu.io](mailto:security@kitsu.io) directly. If you are not sure whether or not something is a security issue it is better to err on the side of caution and contact us at [security@kitsu.io](mailto:security@kitsu.io) first.
